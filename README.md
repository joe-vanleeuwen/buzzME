#buzzME

buzzMe was a group project involving [joe-vanleeuwen](https://github.com/joe-vanleeuwen), [calebbradley](https://github.com/calebbradley), and [FlackAp](https://github.com/FlackAp). During our time at [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/), the three of us completed this project for an assignment.

buzzMe is a chat program using [Parse](http://parse.com/) for the backend, completed in roughly 5 days.
